                            <p style="color: var(--bs-gray-900);">Lemonbox is a personalized vitamin product. It has three features that have attracted a lot of consumers&nbsp;</p><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/Lemonbox/honesty_kv.png">
                            <p></p>
                            <p></p>
                            <h2>��·&nbsp; &nbsp;Easy questionnaires</h2>
                            <p style="margin-left: 4%;">To have a knowledge of their health situation, they just fill the Lemonbox questionnaire and get a health evaluation, based on the evaluation, they could know which nourishment are suitable to them.</p>
                            <h2>&nbsp;·&nbsp; &nbsp;One pocket per day &nbsp;</h2>
                            <p style="margin-left: 4%;">But since many people are attracted to purchase it, they seldom buy it again. As a result, we did the user research to explore what happened between their first attempt and subsequent refusal</p>
                            <h2>&nbsp;·&nbsp; &nbsp;Easy to carry&nbsp;</h2>
                            <p style="margin-left: 4%;">Different medicines are packaged within a pocket.users don’t need to carry them from different bottles and it’s onvenient for them under the context of evection</p>
                            <p>Since health has become an impressing problem for people, they reach out for all kinds of tonics. Lemonbox has received popularity due to its multiple advantages.</p>
                            <h2>But users don’t buy Lemonbox anymore. </h2>
                            <p>But since many people are attracted to purchase it, they seldom buy it again. As a result, we did the user research to explore what happened between their first attempt and subsequent refusal</p>
                            <p style="font-style: italic;text-align: center;padding-top: 30px;">To better research this problem, we need to have a basic classification of the situation the users are faced with. Since the repurchase loss happens frequently between their first attempt and second hesitation, it's necessary to research the reason why they are initially attracted, the feeling they have when taking Lemonbox and the evaluation they have when considering repurchasing it.</p>
                            <figure class="figure d-block"></figure>
                            <h2>Why are they initially attracted?</h2>
                            <p>We did user research to explore their motivation.</p>
                            <p>With 11 people under research, we talked with them about their life state, working environment, physical condition by flexibly-set talks. We try to catch the thread that hides under their purchase.</p>
                            <p>We found their life has suffered from several problems. Since their professions are students, financial figures, and other types that tend to stay up late and lack a regular lifestyle, their problems are universal and unstable.</p>
                            <h2>&nbsp;·&nbsp; &nbsp;Long-term unchangeable lifestyle</h2>
                            <p style="margin-left: 4%;">They are suffering from burdened life, with much coursework or report to finish. Hence, even in the midnight they would have coffee and excels together. Sometimes due to the urgent time limit, they reverse their day and night with no regular work and rest. It’s the long-term situation.</p>
                            <h2 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">&nbsp;·&nbsp; &nbsp;universal and chronic symptoms</h2>
                            <picture><img src="1FE849FD0BB9B6CD251ABFD2678FF7AA.jpg" style="width: 80%;margin-left: 10%;margin-top: 10px;margin-bottom: 10px;"></picture>
                            <p style="margin-left: 4%;">Under this life situation, their body becomes weak gradually. They have increasingly serious problems such as eyestrain, headache, anxiety , sleeplessness which are changing their life without being noticed.</p>
                            <h2>&nbsp;·&nbsp; &nbsp;accidental and intense symptoms</h2>
                            <picture><img src="assets/img/Lemonbox/Intense%20symptom.jpg" style="width: 80%;margin-left: 10%;margin-top: 10px;margin-bottom: 10px;"></picture>
                            <p style="margin-left: 4%;">Meanwhile, due to the unhealthy lifestyle, they would suffer from sudden gastrointestinal discomfort or alopecia. The intense pain or symptom would catch their attention and at this time, they reach out for Lemonbox and hope to get their expected effect-- to cure their symptoms.</p>
                        </div>
                        <h2 style="font-size: 20px;">Disappearance of service and favorability</h2>
                        <p style="font-size: 16px;">With their first purchase and attempt, consumers began to test whether Lemonbox was efficient and fitted them. But the expectation was wrongly placed.</p>
                        <h2 style="font-size: 20px;">&nbsp;·&nbsp; &nbsp;gap between 1 month and course of treatment</h2>
                        <picture><img src="4FCA8E5BB5207AA6A646F465C4326276.jpg" style="width: 80%;margin-left: 10%;margin-top: 10px;margin-bottom: 10px;"></picture>
                        <p style="margin-left: 4%;margin-bottom: 20px;">Lemonbox standard version, the first choice for consumers’ attempt, is for 1 month per package. But the course of treatment for the symptoms is complicated, which are influenced by many factors such as life habits or physical fitness.</p>
                        <p style="margin-left: 4%;margin-bottom: 20px;">Despite Lemonbox providing both relief and cure for chronic and intense symptoms respectively, they only care about intense symptoms, which are opposite to their lifestyle, indicating the symptoms are universal and hard to change.&nbsp;</p>

                                <p class="description" style="padding-right: 12px;padding-left: 12px;">Are my symptoms removed? Consumers complain that Lemonbox didn’t remove their issues within a month, although they didn’t notice how much has the symptoms been relieved. They mistake Lemonbox as medicine to offset the bad conditions they confronted.</p>

                                <p class="description" style="padding-right: 12px;padding-left: 12px;">The role Lemonbox plays in consumers’ life is health care products, while people expect Lemonbox to cure their symptoms within 1 month, and this fails their expectations.</p>

                            <p>According to the survey, an accustomed habit would be forgotten after pause for 7 days. Corona Virus caused the delay of delivery. Therefore , due to the long waiting they have experienced in the first time, they are unhurried to repurchase it, which led to their forgetting this habit.</p>

                            <p>Consumers tend to accept more expensive Lemonbox when they are under serious condition, while care more about the price when they are good. They weight the price based on their health. If they are in desparate need of better health, they would be somewhat blind to price.</p>
                        </div>

                            <p>When they look back on their progress, they just care about whether they are better, while the effects are displayed as maintaining conditions under overburdened work or stress. Lack of obvious effects makes them give up repurchase.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <h2 style="font-size: 20px;margin-top: 89px;text-align: center;font-style: italic;">Therefore, we improved the interaction design of Lemonbox so that it could better serve people.</h2>
                    <h2 style="font-size: 35px;margin-top: 89px;text-align: left;color: rgb(217,221,30);">Keep the service, keep the favorability</h2>
                    <p>We try to make consumers always perceive the existence of service through iteration on interfaces.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, we proposed weekly questionnaires to get feedback from consumers. In turn, we give them weekly report based on their life habits, balance between work and rest to give them suggestions continually during their processing of taking it.</p>
