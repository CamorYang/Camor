                    <b>Volume perception:</b> We squeeze the space within palms and fingers to sense the volume.

                <div>
                    To adapt the fixed form factor onto different virtual objects, we simulate the minor change on shape and volume through compound layers, specifically <b>pairing rigid with elastic materials.</b>

                    To form the feedback and interaction, we applied subtle vibration, natural behavior, and sprite metaphor as 3 interaction principles here.
