                    I am a second year Master’s student at Georgia Tech majoring in Digital Media, under School of Literature, Media, and Communication, supervised  by Professor <b>Michael Nitsche</b>. I also work with Professor <b>HyunJoo Oh</b> and <b>Noura Howell</b>.                
                </div>
                
                <br>

                <div>
                    I used to work as a user research, designer, technologist focusing on applying wide-ranging design through ethnographic insights on <b>tangible and embodied interaction</b>.

                <div>
                    My research vision lies on <b>interweaving embodiment and agents for interpersonal dynamics to augment human on an emotional level</b>. As human always relief social dilemma through another “speaking for us”, we perform a separated agency to resolve this issue. Agents provide potential pathway to augment such situation. Specifically, I aim to take agent as a second self to speak for human’s hesitation. I do not limit the augmentation within verbal interaction. Instead, I design embodiment of agents to build <b>nonverbal communication with counterparts</b>, and integrate <b>trustworthy exbodiment</b> with owners. I dive into how to design such embodiment, exbodiment as a second self, and how would augmented human realize the <b>blended control, intelligence, and perceived agency</b> with the agents.
