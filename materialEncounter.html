            <h1 class = "title"> Triangulate ‘Listening’ to Materials</h1>
            <div class="author"> Michael Nitsche, Jialuo Yang</div>
            <div class="abstract"> <b>Abstract:</b> To listen to materials is an often-repeated claim in design, yet methodolo- gies on how to perform such a task are less clear. First, this paper will review forms of material encounters by leaning on more-than-human design and hybrid craft. It asks how the concept of “listening” changed with the emergence of material agencies. Second, it will suggest its core approach: to focus not on the human-material encoun- ter but to stage a material-material encounter that opens up a relational “triangu- lated listening” position. Third, it will provide an example case showing possible ap- proaches for such a third-party listening set up. Overall, it contributes a method that informs one form of listening to materials in design through theory and practice.

                Tacit knowledge has received increasing interest in craft and hybrid craft research [22,23,30,36]. Practitioners and researchers have traditionally used photos, videos, and journals to document the tacit and experiential knowledge at work in the craft process. Such documentation enables the recording and surfacing of the embodied sensory experience to the conscious level, so practitioners could conduct reflection-in-action or reflection-on-action activities [22, 23, 53, 31]. Groth et al. document experiential knowledge in pottery making using journals, experience sampling questionnaires, and videos. In the reflection of the documented materials, they uncovered tacit aspects that allowed them to have a deeper understanding of their practice [23]. Studying the role of the documentation on the communication and teaching of tacit craft techniques, Endow and Torres conducted two studies looking at people’s understanding of craft-making documentations and tutorials in different forms. They discussed them, both in terms of their media (e.g. photos vs. videos) and the way the content is arranged (e.g. collage or step-by-step pictorials) [12]. In one study, Endow and Torres looked at the experience of novice potters centering clay using three different kinds of tutorials. They found that the photo- and video-based tutorials are limited in communicating the tacit aspects of the practice. The second study addresses ambiguity introduced by conventional documentation of motions by introducing the Tacit Description Typology (TDT). They utilize crowd-sourced audiences to interpret a craft practice. TDT emerges from the descriptions provided by this audience and covers various aspects of the experience such as the haptics, visuals, and sound. It can be used to facilitate the documentation of tacit knowledge but it remains limited to visual observation.
                Sensing technologies, including computer vision and affordable sensors in tangible design, trace performance and tacit knowledge in a more quantifiable way by capturing details that are not captured by an image. The sensing technologies used for sensing tacit knowledge in craft have been deployed on the body [30, 5], the tool [56] and the environment [15]. For example, attempts of capturing tacit knowledge at work in pottery utilized EMG sensors to capture data that was used for teaching [5] and reflection purposes [30]. Flanagan and Fraietta employ computer vision to track finger movements during embroidery [15]. Smith et al. installed sensors on the end of crochet sticks to track and sonify their movement to facilitate reflection and learning from each other in group settings [56]. Projects like these establish tangible interaction design as a domain to support the overall goal of tracing performance and tacit knowledge at work.

                <b> Case Study</b>
                <p>
                    The following design project serves as a practical example for the theoretical triangulation model outlined above. In terms of its development, the study followed initially established trajectories in hybrid craft design. It started with close observations of a material (step 1) through personal encounters. These included use of the material experiential design tool kit by Camere/Karana (Camere & Karana, 2018). It also included an autoethnographic exercise during the papermaking, which included soma-design methods (Tsaknaki et al., 2019), such as body sheets. In the second step, the designer conducted practice observations as they vis- ited an active crafter working with the material. This required observation of how to handle the materials and tools in specific environments (step 2). Informed by these experiences, the designer ideated a material encounter between the chosen first and a second material – the triangulation of listening proposed here (step 3). Finally, based on the nature of that encoun- ter the digital intervention was designed and implemented (step 4). The first two steps are to establish forms of personal observation of material properties in relation to oneself and the practice of others in relation to the material (Sennett, 2008). These are necessary steps to approach the materials and the practices surrounding them. Step 3 features the concep- tual shift outlined above. Instead of building directly on this emerging human-material en- counter, the triangulation took the designer out of immediate contact and emphasized ma- terial relationships first. Those developing relationships depended on the materials’ own conditions/ activities/ timeframe. They emphasize material encounters that a human would most likely not realize. Emphasizing these material conditions first allowed the subsequent design of a digital intervention based on a novel “listening” position that remained aware of a human experience of the material but shifted it toward the material-material enactment first. Finally, these designs were implemented and operated (step 4). The novel human “lis- tening” emerged in this operation and operating the prototypes is essential. The design em- phasized the material-material relation first and put the human in a novel position towards this encounter. Given the focus on the triangulation model, here we will report on this com- ponent and will merely outline the initial material encounter and practice exploration steps.

                    The Active Paper case study focused on paper as the material. Key material encounters with paper involve the experience with its texture, folding/ creases, and physical behavior. Paper- making practices were observed with a local crafter and translated into own experiments at papermaking. Typically, the process of papermaking can be categorized into various steps such as processing fiber, making pulp, screening, compression, and dehydration. Each of these steps alters the emerging properties such as transparency, roughness, flatness, thick- ness, smoothness, and color of the emerging paper (Hunter, 1978 (1947)). They affect the paper’s properties and specific agencies. Herein, different instances of paper were created for this project to allow for a range of these features.

                    Triangulation was achieved via inclusion of a second material encounter. This encounter cen- tered on the moment when a pen would touch the paper surface. Human experience of this encounter is often neglected or uniform. If the paper is optimized for a smooth writing expe- rience this encounter might go unnoticed. If a paper or pen creates a specific, constant feel- ing during the writing experience, this encounter would stay consistent and predictable. Countering this lack of perception, the project focused on this encounter of the tip of a pen with a paper as a unique and constantly emerging activity between two active material com- ponents acting upon each other. The digital intervention prototype, then, focused on bring- ing this moment forward to the human participant.
