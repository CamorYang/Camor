It integrates accessible social services through low-tech booklets, stamps to help Chinese elderly prevent themselves from cardiovascular diseases, mutually help within patient communities, and cultivate healthcare habits.            </div>

                        Cardiovascular diseases(CVDs) are one of leading causes of deaths. Globally, over half survived patients lose self-care ability. While edging technologies helped a lot, Chinese elderly cannot access it efficiently. Also, the discrimination and negligence for CVDs make them reluctant to seek help. These difficulty hinders them from adjusting to routines good for prevention and improvement.
                        The interwound problems frames through 3 parts.

                    We conducted qualitative research with patients, doctors, and patient relatives. These patient-centered communities uncovers their treatment within disease, caregiving after diseases and self help on disease.

                    Elderly patients hold trust toward peers with similar conditions, while they distrust doctors.
                    <br><br>
                    Elderly is too frustrated to cultivate self discipline.
                    <br><br>
                    Elderly patients are shamed from illness and diseases.

                    Given that elderly rely more on traditional media such as paper artifacts, we embed services into a booklet. The booklet includes intro page, coupons, and stamps that enables their peer communication, redeeming service, and habit cultivation.
