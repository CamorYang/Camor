            <div class="author"> Michael Nitsche, Jialuo Yang, Yilin Elaine Liu, Yuxi Chen</div>
            <div class="abstract"> <b>Abstract:</b> We discuss existent approaches to trace tacit knowledge in craft practices through a turn to more-than-human centered design. This leads to a call for a multi-layered sensing system that covers not only the human body but also the tools and materials involved. Furthermore, it stresses the necessity of relational data collection and analysis. We present the design and implementation of this concept for a traditional woodworking practice: evening out wood with a block plane. In closing, we show feasibility of the suggested design through an initial pilot test. The argument contributes a theoretical turn to material-based sensing principles in the search for ways to track tacit knowledge, it outlines key design principles of this approach, provides an example implementation, and indicates a first validation through pilot data.</div>

                Tacit knowledge has received increasing interest in craft and hybrid craft research [22,23,30,36]. Practitioners and researchers have traditionally used photos, videos, and journals to document the tacit and experiential knowledge at work in the craft process. Such documentation enables the recording and surfacing of the embodied sensory experience to the conscious level, so practitioners could conduct reflection-in-action or reflection-on-action activities [22, 23, 53, 31]. Groth et al. document experiential knowledge in pottery making using journals, experience sampling questionnaires, and videos. In the reflection of the documented materials, they uncovered tacit aspects that allowed them to have a deeper understanding of their practice [23]. Studying the role of the documentation on the communication and teaching of tacit craft techniques, Endow and Torres conducted two studies looking at people’s understanding of craft-making documentations and tutorials in different forms. They discussed them, both in terms of their media (e.g. photos vs. videos) and the way the content is arranged (e.g. collage or step-by-step pictorials) [12]. In one study, Endow and Torres looked at the experience of novice potters centering clay using three different kinds of tutorials. They found that the photo- and video-based tutorials are limited in communicating the tacit aspects of the practice. The second study addresses ambiguity introduced by conventional documentation of motions by introducing the Tacit Description Typology (TDT). They utilize crowd-sourced audiences to interpret a craft practice. TDT emerges from the descriptions provided by this audience and covers various aspects of the experience such as the haptics, visuals, and sound. It can be used to facilitate the documentation of tacit knowledge but it remains limited to visual observation.
                Sensing technologies, including computer vision and affordable sensors in tangible design, trace performance and tacit knowledge in a more quantifiable way by capturing details that are not captured by an image. The sensing technologies used for sensing tacit knowledge in craft have been deployed on the body [30, 5], the tool [56] and the environment [15]. For example, attempts of capturing tacit knowledge at work in pottery utilized EMG sensors to capture data that was used for teaching [5] and reflection purposes [30]. Flanagan and Fraietta employ computer vision to track finger movements during embroidery [15]. Smith et al. installed sensors on the end of crochet sticks to track and sonify their movement to facilitate reflection and learning from each other in group settings [56]. Projects like these establish tangible interaction design as a domain to support the overall goal of tracing performance and tacit knowledge at work.

                One way to approach tacit knowledge is via comparing the performances of experts and those of amateurs. Wood et al. studied the craft of sharpening blades to argue for bridges for crossing the knowledge gap when master craftspeople teach amateurs [61]. These can work through different means during which the tacit knowledge is not made explicit but activated through a reciprocal reflection involving both the master craftspeople and the amateurs. As actions are performed, tacit knowledge is gained and applied. Through sensing the actions, one could capture data on the contributing actors that allows a comparative analysis.
                The review of the related work identified a limited range of projects that focus on tacit knowledge in HCI and tangible interaction design. Current approaches rely largely on human reflection and consider the tacit knowledge production as rooted in the participation of the human. In contrast, the summary of the conceptual re-framing laid the groundwork for a turn to a more-than-human design perspective that includes human contributions but sees them as one of the components in a wider activity network that emphasizes relations between humans, tools, and materials. These relations would be comparable if enough data across different actors were collected. Four basic design criteria for the necessary sensing setup emerge:
                <p>• Sense the material: detect data from the material at hand and how it changes during the encounter (examples: heat, movement, form, or color changes)</p>
                <p>• Sense the body: detect data from the human body and how it changes during the encounter (examples: muscle activation, posture, gestures)</p>
                <p>• Sense the tool: detect data from the tool performance (examples: speed, direction, alterations)</p>
                <p>• Allow relational data examination across actors: record data in relation to time and characterizing events (examples:shared timeline, reliable sensing speed, frequency, synchronized video recording)</p>
                These criteria are additions to existent approaches that focused on personal reflection and visual tracking only. What they add is an opportunity to include multi-layered and relational data points from more actors in the practice. This allows for the possible recognition of nuanced patterns within performances. Such patterns could reveal representations of tacit knowledge and assist in teaching existent craft practices, developing novel tangibles, or other forms of embodied design.
