                <br>
                We discuss existent approaches to trace tacit knowledge in craft practices through a turn to more-than-human centered design. This leads to a call for a multi-layered sensing system that covers not only the human body but also the tools and materials involved. Furthermore, it stresses the necessity of relational data collection and analysis. We present the design and implementation of this concept for a traditional woodworking practice: evening out wood with a block plane. In closing, we show feasibility of the suggested design through an initial pilot test. The argument contributes a theoretical turn to material-based sensing principles in the search for ways to track tacit knowledge, it outlines key design principles of this approach, provides an example implementation, and indicates a first validation through pilot data.</div>

                Tacit knowledge has received increasing interest in craft and hybrid craft research [22,23,30,36]. Practitioners and researchers have traditionally used photos, videos, and journals to document the tacit and experiential knowledge at work in the craft process. Such documentation enables the recording and surfacing of the embodied sensory experience to the conscious level, so practitioners could conduct reflection-in-action or reflection-on-action activities [22, 23, 53, 31]. Groth et al. document experiential knowledge in pottery making using journals, experience sampling questionnaires, and videos. In the reflection of the documented materials, they uncovered tacit aspects that allowed them to have a deeper understanding of their practice [23]. Studying the role of the documentation on the communication and teaching of tacit craft techniques, Endow and Torres conducted two studies looking at peopleâ€™s understanding of craft-making documentations and tutorials in different forms. They discussed them, both in terms of their media (e.g. photos vs. videos) and the way the content is arranged (e.g. collage or step-by-step pictorials) [12]. In one study, Endow and Torres looked at the experience of novice potters centering clay using three different kinds of tutorials. They found that the photo- and video-based tutorials are limited in communicating the tacit aspects of the practice. The second study addresses ambiguity introduced by conventional documentation of motions by introducing the Tacit Description Typology (TDT). They utilize crowd-sourced audiences to interpret a craft practice. TDT emerges from the descriptions provided by this audience and covers various aspects of the experience such as the haptics, visuals, and sound. It can be used to facilitate the documentation of tacit knowledge but it remains limited to visual observation.
                Sensing technologies, including computer vision and affordable sensors in tangible design, trace performance and tacit knowledge in a more quantifiable way by capturing details that are not captured by an image. The sensing technologies used for sensing tacit knowledge in craft have been deployed on the body [30, 5], the tool [56] and the environment [15]. For example, attempts of capturing tacit knowledge at work in pottery utilized EMG sensors to capture data that was used for teaching [5] and reflection purposes [30]. Flanagan and Fraietta employ computer vision to track finger movements during embroidery [15]. Smith et al. installed sensors on the end of crochet sticks to track and sonify their movement to facilitate reflection and learning from each other in group settings [56]. Projects like these establish tangible interaction design as a domain to support the overall goal of tracing performance and tacit knowledge at work.
